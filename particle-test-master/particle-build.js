// Controlling LEDs over the Internet
// -----------------------------------

/* First, let's create our "shorthand" for the pins
Same as in the Blink an LED example:
led1 is D0, led2 is D7 */
int led = D0; // This is where your LED is plugged in. The other side goes to a resistor connected to GND.
int boardLed = D7; // This is the LED that is already on your device.
// On the Core, it's the LED in the upper right hand corner.
// On the Photon, it's next to the D7 pin.

int photoresistor = A0; // This is where your photoresistor is plugged in. The other side goes to the "power" pin (below).

int power = A5; // This is the other end of your photoresistor. The other side is plugged into the "photoresistor" pin (above).

// The following values get set up when your device boots up and calibrates:
int intactValue; // This is the average value that the photoresistor reads when the beam is intact.
int brokenValue; // This is the average value that the photoresistor reads when the beam is broken.
int beamThreshold; // This is a value halfway between ledOnValue and ledOffValue, above which we will assume the led is on and below which we will assume it is off.

bool beamBroken = false; // This flag will be used to mark if we have a new status or not. We will use it in the loop.

// This time, we are also going to register our Particle function

    pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);

    pinMode(photoresistor,INPUT);  // Our photoresistor pin is input (reading the photoresistor)
    pinMode(power,OUTPUT); // The pin powering the photoresistor is output (sending out consistent power)

   // We are also going to declare a Particle.function so that we can turn the LED on and off from the cloud.
   Particle.function("led",ledToggle);
   // This is saying that when we ask the cloud for the function "led", it will employ the function ledToggle() from this app.

   // For good measure, let's also make sure both LEDs are off when we start:

  // Now we'll take some readings...
  int on_1 = analogRead(photoresistor); // read photoresistor
  delay(200); // wait 200 milliseconds
  int on_2 = analogRead(photoresistor); // read photoresistor
  delay(300); // wait 300 milliseconds

  // Now the D7 LED will go on to tell you to remove your hand...
  digitalWrite(boardLed,HIGH);
  delay(2000);

  // The D7 LED will turn off...
  digitalWrite(boardLed,LOW);

  // ...And we will take two more readings.
  int off_1 = analogRead(photoresistor); // read photoresistor
  delay(200); // wait 200 milliseconds
  int off_2 = analogRead(photoresistor); // read photoresistor
  delay(1000); // wait 1 second

  // Now flash the D7 LED on and off three times to let us know that we're ready to go!
